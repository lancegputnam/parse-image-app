Image Application 
===============
After working with Backbone, our class made the transition to Parse and created photo applications with the language. FolkGram allows you to add a photo and caption, which will post on the application. You can also add and resize a frame over the main image, which is done in part by Fabric.JS. The next step in this application will be to allow for ability to add a frame or filter over any image and allow the user the save the image.
